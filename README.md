# Digit Sum Calculator

This Java project allows users to input a number and calculates the sum of its digits. It's a simple console-based application that demonstrates basic input handling, loops, and arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Accepts user input for any integer.
- Calculates the sum of the digits in the entered number.
- Displays the result to the user in a user-friendly format.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Using a `do-while` loop, the program extracts each digit of the number by repeatedly taking the remainder when divided by 10.
3. Each digit is added to a result variable.
4. The process continues until all digits are processed.
5. The sum of the digits is then displayed to the user.

## Example

```bash
Welcome!
Please enter a number to calculate the sum of its digits.
Input: 1234

The sum of the digits is: 10
```

## How to Run

 1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
 2.  2. Copy the source code into a file named Main.java.
 3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
 4. Navigate to the directory where the Main.java file is located.

 5. Compile the Java program using the following command:
```
javac Main.java
```
 6. Run the compiled Java program using the command:
```
java Main
```
 7. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to input your number.

## Requirements

-Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
